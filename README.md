### Hey there!!
Vivek here - a Software Developer working in VFX technology.
I spend my time building tools, pipelines and systems to make the creative workflows faster (performance-enthusiastic).

### I Geek out on...

- My least favourite is the Memory leaks (the silent types)

### What I'm playing with right now?
- Writing an actual "Player", a high performance media player and a growing review system.
- Learning to encode-decode the audio and video streams for fast and efficient playback.

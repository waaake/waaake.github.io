### Hey, I'm Vivek👋

Nice to meet you! I'm a software developer working in VFX technology. I spend my time building tools, pipelines and systems that make the creative workflows better and faster. Performance and efficiency are the things I really care about.

I'm intrested in VFX and gaming industry, especially in Graphics programming. The math behind rendering each frame (pixels and voxels) excites me and keeps me curios to learn more.
Before moving into software development, I worked on the creative side of VFX, animating 3D characters. That experience helps me understand the creaive vision behind projects, making me better at designing technical systems that support creative teams.
